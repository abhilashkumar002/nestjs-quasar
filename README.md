## Vue Technical Review

**Goal:** Demonstrate that you can create a Vue application that can retrieve and display user data from a remote endpoint.

Please describe your thought-process while performing the tasks and steps needed to complete.

Requirements:

- Must be a Vue 2 application that supports Vue Router.
- Requires default route to display summary of user data, with link to details.
- Requires route that will display additional details about one user with link back to list
- Add a "Not Found" component for unmatched routes

Use the following endpoint for the users data: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`

You may use any resources available to you, eg: Vue documentation, Google-fu, etc., but please ensure you are sharing.
