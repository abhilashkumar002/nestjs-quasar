## NestJS/Quasar Technical Review

### Goal

Demonstrate you can create (1) a simple backend API using NestJS; and (2) a simple Vue 3 single page application (SPA) using Quasar v2 that uses the API.

Please describe your thought-process while performing the tasks and steps needed to complete this.

### Setup

- Clone this repository and create a feature branch for your work
- The NestJS API should be created in the `api` folder and contain its own `package.json` file
- The VueJS UI should be created in the `ui` folder and contain its own `package.json` file
- When you reach a stopping point, create a PR to the `development` branch from your feature branch.

### Requirements

- Use [NestJS v9](https://docs.nestjs.com/v9/)
- Must use [Quasar v2](https://quasar.dev) and Vue Router
- A default route to display a tabular summary of sample user data with a link/route to view user details
- Add a simple "Not Found" component or page for unmatched routes

Sample user data is in the [sample-data](./sample-data/) folder.

You may use any resources available to you, eg: Vue docs, Quasar docs, NestJS docs, the interviewers, Google, etc.
